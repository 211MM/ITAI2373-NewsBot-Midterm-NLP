# ITAI2373-NewsBot-Midterm
The NewsBot Midterm project is about building a system that reads news articles, cleans and analyzes the text, and categories content into topics such as Politics or Sports. In combining everything i have learned throuhghout my semester in NLP, the creation of a full working tool that mimics how real-world news platforms understand and use written content will be born. In my contribution of the portion ofPOS Pattern analysis and text preprocessing pipeline was a tough challenge but in all i manage to pull through. In my reviewing of the whole project after everything it was great to see what me and my partner had managed to create together.
